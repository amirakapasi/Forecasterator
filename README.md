Forecasterator Capstone Project
Jan 2022 - April 2022

A web based app that allows users to manipulate sea level rise over a map of Charleston SC, in order to determine future loss to local tourism and real estate.
The tool will use a backend of Google firebase that contains data of roughly 600+ airbnb locations. These will be displayed on a map, using the Google Maps API so that a user can see the extent of the loss of land during sea level rise. As the sea level rises many properties will be affected, consequences ranging from increased prices to being submerged underwater.
